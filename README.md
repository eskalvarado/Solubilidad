# Solubilidad

Hey, Edgard, I took the time to make this so it would be easier for you to do. If you click on main.tex you should be capable of adding your discussion and conclusion. If you have any doubts just tell me. All the other files, inclduing the tex and PDF files, are still in the google drive. I made this so you wouldn't need to install a tex editor and compiler; to cooperate on any changes.
